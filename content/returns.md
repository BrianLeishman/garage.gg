### Within 30 days

You must contact our support team about any issues with your order within 30 days ofÂ delivery

### Includes original packaging & product in like-new condition

Any returned product(s) must be returned with any original packaging, and in the condition which the product(s) arrived. Very Good Garage may reject the returned product if there is damage to the product and/or product packaging. If a returned product is rejected, no refund will be issued to the customer, and the customer may choose to have the product shipped back to them at their own cost. If the customer chooses not to ship the product back to them, Very Good Garage will recycle or dispose of the product.
